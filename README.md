# Gv Framework: Getting Started

## Introduction

Gv is a Node.js backend framework that has been built and is fully compatible with Typescript. It also allows developers to code in pure Javascript. Under the hood, Gv uses robust HTTP server frameworks such as Express.

## Philosophy

Gv was conceived with the goal of accelerating the construction of REST applications. It provides a set of tools that empower and simplify the Express framework, without introducing complexity. In this way, developers can maintain the convenience and freedom that Express offers.

## Installation

To install Gv, you can use npm. Simply run the following command:

```
npm i gv-framework

```
